## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Writing *R for Plant Disease Epidemiology (R4PDE)* has been an eye-opening experience, and I couldn't have done it without the support and kindness of so many people and organizations.

First, I want to thank Helen Pennington for allowing her stunning painting of coffee leaf rust to be featured on the cover. Her artwork beautifully captures the spirit of plant disease epidemiology, adding a visual layer that perfectly complements the book's content.

I’m also deeply grateful to Prof. Laurence V. Madden for his generosity in sharing data from *The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics*. His contribution has truly enriched the analytical sections of this book.

I’d also like to thank the chapter authors who contributed their expertise. Prof. Ivan A. Lizarazo deserves special mention for his chapter on using remote sensing for disease detection and quantification, which adds valuable insights to the book.

Finally, the open-source community has played a role in shaping *R4PDE*. I’m incredibly thankful to everyone who contributed fixes and improvements, whether through pull requests or other feedback. Your collaboration and input have been invaluable.
