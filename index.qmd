# Welcome {.unnumbered}

**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a dynamic book project rooted in the teachings of the annual graduate course, FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, a key part of the curriculum in the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) at Universidade Federal de Viçosa.

Designed for those passionate about studying and modeling plant disease epidemics with R, the book offers an exploration of diverse methods for describing, visualizing, and analyzing epidemic data collected over time or space. Readers should ideally have a foundational knowledge of R to best utilize the examples.

However, R4PDE is not a resource for learning data science through R, there are already well-established books such as [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for that purpose. Portuguese-speaking readers are recommended [Análises Ecológicas no R](https://analises-ecologicas.netlify.app/) and [Software R para avaliação de dados experimentais](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/e-bookr/index.html) as excellent R learning resources, with an added focus on statistics using R.

The book often draws upon data and replicates analyses from *The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics* [@madden2017]. A mix of general and specific R packages are utilized to conduct common plant disease epidemiology data analysis, notably [epifitter](https://alvesks.github.io/epifitter/) and [epiphy](https://chgigot.github.io/epiphy/), both designed by plant pathologists. In conjunction with this book, a new R package [r4pde](https://github.com/emdelponte/r4pde) has been developed and can be installed from GitHub using:

`# install.packages("remotes")`

`remotes::install_github("emdelponte/r4pde")`

As a work in progress, the book is frequently updated and edited. The website is free to use, licensed under a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), and the code for all analyses can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R). While there are no immediate plans for a printed version, it is under consideration as the book further develops. The website is hosted by https://www.netlify.com/.
