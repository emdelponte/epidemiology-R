Since the early to mid 1900s, warning systems (synonyms: disease forecaster, predictor) have advanced considerably. More comprehensively, these systems have evolved to a Decision Support System (DSS), when they integrate expert input, models, and databases for more nuanced management recommendations, transcending simple prediction to encompass various goals within computerized frameworks. In fact, technological progress in recent decades has boosted the development and automation of DSSs, now widely available in public and private sectors, providing direct, sophisticated guidance to crop advisors and growers (@fig-dss).\n\n![Core elements of a decision support system that provides risk information for plant disease management](imgs/dss.png){#fig-dss fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn its core, a DSS targeting risk prediction for plant disease management are based on a disease **model**, or a simplified, often mathematical, representation of a system (here the pathosystem) used for making predictions or suggesting management decisions based on the risk information they provide. The models range from basic rules (e.g. if-then) and static thresholds to sophisticated simulation models covering entire disease epidemics. Historically, these models collect weather information from on site automatic weather stations, but can be fed with data from remote sensing (e.g. satellite) or data reanalysis sources.\n\n## Risk assessment and decision framework\n\nThere are basically two types of decisions related to plant disease management: tactical and strategical and these can be related to the distinct time frames of information (i.e., historical data, pre-season, growing season, and future seasons). A risk assessment and decision framework, with associated terminology, can be proposed based on such relations (@fig-timeline) and its components are explained next.\n\n![Framework and associated terminology for plant disease risk assessment](imgs/timeline.png){#fig-timeline fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**Historical** data and prediction refers to those obtained from or simulated for previous years or seasons. This can include past observed weather patterns, observed or simulated disease outbreaks. The goal is to learn about the \"normal\" patterns associated with disease prevalence and severity. In the p**re-season** period, predictions are made before the actual planting or growing season starts. This could be based on early predictions of weather patterns for the season. During the **growing season,** real-time data is used to provide short-term predictions. This is the period when crops are in the fields and are actively monitored. Finally, for **future seasons,** projections (e.g. climate change scenarios) can be made for the subsequent years or decades.\n\n**Strategical** decisions are those with a long-term impact and are typically based on historical data and projections for future seasons. Examples might include choosing where to plant the crops in the next years, which cultivar to plant, and making infrastructure investments. **Tactical** are short-term decisions typically based on real-time data or short-term predictions, especially those relevant to the current growing season. A chief example include the timing of fungicide applications.\n\nAs to risk terminology, **risk analysis** is a comprehensive assessment of potential disease risks, considering both historical data and projections of the future. The goal is to understand and mitigate potential threats to agricultural production. **Risk prediction** can be broken down into a) **outlook:** Broad predictions or estimations about potential risks, often based on pre-season data. Example: effects that El Niño Southern Oscilation (ENSO) may have on disease patterns; b) **forecasting:** short-term predictions, typically for the growing season, such as critical weather events; and c) **warning:** Immediate alerts about imminent risks, like an upcoming risk of plant infection, crucial for tactical decisions.\n\nIn this chapter we will focus on warning systems that make use of disease monitoring or seasonal weather to provide risk information for tactical decisions.\n\n## When is a warning system needed?\n\nThe figure and the box below provide some information on their utility. In the figure, risk analysis is defined as an approach for pathogens/diseases that are not present in a target region and for which modeling can be used for risk estimation if the disease is highly damaging where it occurs. Warning systems can be used if the disease is more erratic but still damaging when occuring. If the epidemics are too frequent and no effective and economic control is available (for example, some nematodes and virus), plant host resistance is the way to go. If there are effective and economic control measures (e.g. fungicide sprays) during the season, farmers should follows scheduled application of treatments.\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-diagram2\n%%| fig-cap: \"Decision chart for the need of risk analysis, warning systems, schedule treatment or host resistance in disease management\"\n%%| fig-width: 4\nflowchart\n    Start((Start))\n    A{Disease<BR>present?}\n    B{Highly<BR>damaging?}\n    C[Risk Analysis]\n    D{Damaging?}\n    E{Frequent<BR>epidemics?}\n    F[Scheduled treatments]\n    G[Warning System]\n    H{Economic<BR>control?}\n    I[Host Resistance]\n\n    Start --> A\n    A -->|N| B\n    B -->|N| Start\n    D -->|N| Start\n    A -->|Y| D\n    D -->|Y| E\n    E -->|Y| H\n    B -->|Y| C\n    E -->|N| G\n    H -->|N| I\n    H -->|Y| F\n    \n\n```\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n## When is a warning system useful?\n\nFor operational and economical use, warning systems must fulfill four criteria to be practical. A more comprehensive discussion on this topic is presented in [@Campbell1990]:\n\n1.  The targeted disease must be economically damaging to crop yield or quality. Minor diseases with negligible effects on yield or quality are unlikely to gain attention from growers and advisors.\n\n2.  The diseases should exhibit variability across seasons in terms of onset, epidemic growth rate, severity, or another aspect, creating uncertainty in decision-making. Diseases with predictable patterns provide minimal information and little management advantage, reducing the relevance of warning systems.\n\n3.  Users should be capable of acting on the system's alerts, necessitating available and effective control measures and sufficient response time to prevent crop damage. Systems are unhelpful if practitioners can't adapt their strategies promptly.\n\n4.  The system must encompass comprehensive knowledge about the disease, synthesizing accurate risk estimates. Understanding the specific interactions between host, pathogen, and environment is crucial for the system's effectiveness and relevance.\n:::\n\n## What types of systems are there?\n\nThese systems vary significantly in structure and design, reflecting the multitude of plant diseases, objectives, available data, control strategies, developer preferences, and operational infrastructures. Usually, warning system are based on weather inputs, but they might leverage other inputs like host, pathogen, and economic factors, catering to the complexities of disease prediction.\n\nDisease warning systems can include static or dynamic disease thresholds, direct detection of inoculum, simple rules of thumb (e.g. if-then) based on weather, infection risk during defined periods (risk models), or complex simulation models that estimate all phases of an epidemic. Let's see some examples of these systems together with a possible implementation in R.\n\n### Disease thresholds\n\nDamaging thresholds, integral to integrated pest management in entomology, can serve as a basic disease warning system. They involve economic injury levels, denoting pest abundance that equates control costs with incurred losses, and economic or action thresholds, indicating when action is necessary to avoid reaching injury levels [@pedigo1986]. These concepts, while straightforward, can be quite complex in practical scenarios.\n\nThough less prevalent than in arthropod management, thresholds guide actions like fungicide application in plant diseases, especially those directly impacting yield through photosynthetic area reduction [@leiminger2012; @nutter1993terms]. However, their application is challenging for rapid, recurrent diseases affecting high-value crops, requiring prompt intervention even at minimal disease levels. With potato late blight, for instance, the first fungicide application may need to be applied by the time disease severity reaches as low as 0.1% of the foliage. Hence, disease monitoring for detection and quantification is vital for this system. In reality, for some rapid spreading and highly damaging diseases one cannot wait to \"see\" the disease to start protecting the crops, for which yield protection is best when applications are made preventatively.\n\nHowever, the concept of **economic damage threshold** (EDT) may be used as a criteria do indicate when to start with fungicide sprays. By definition, EDT is the amount of disease intensity (e.g. severity when dealing with foliar diseases) that corresponds to an economic loss that equates the control cost to combat the disease. A formula for the EDT was proposed by Mumford and Norton [@mumford1984] and further modified by Reis [@reis2002modelo] for use in foliar fungal diseases, as described in Equation 3:\n\n$EDT = \\frac{F_C}{C_P . D_C} . C_e$ ,\n\nwhere EDT is the disease intensity, $F_C$ is the fungicide cost (USD/ha), $C_P$ is the crop selling price (USD/ton), $D_C$ is the damage coefficient (adjusted to potential yield) and $C_e$ is the control efficacy of the fungicide (proportion of disease reduction relative to non-treated). In practice, sprays should be applied prior to reaching the EDT, which gives rise to the ADT (action damage threshold).\n\nIn a study on northern corn leaf blight in Argentina, the following values were used to calculate the EDT [@derossi2022]. Note that the authors adjusted the Dc to potential yield by multiplying by the potential yield value (8.5 ton.ha) in metric tons, since the Dc is normalized to one metric ton. More about Dc in the dedicated chapter on [yield loss](yieldloss-regression-models.html#damage-coefficients). The action damage threshold (ADT) was defined in that study as 20% reduction of the EDT.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='warning-systems_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_8efbca0ff9db039810a92c71285af3a4'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate_EDT <- function(Fc, Cp, Dc, Ec) {\n  EDT <- (Fc / (Cp * Dc)) * Ce\n  return(EDT)\n}\nFc <- 30      # fixed cost of control is 30 USD/ha.\nCp <- 112     # fixed crop price is 112 USD/ton.\nDc <- 0.1712  # for potential yield of 8.5 t/ha so 8.5 x 0.02015 = 0.1712.\nCe <- 0.70    # control efficacy of fungicide is 70%.\nEDT_value <- calculate_EDT(Fc, Cp, Dc, Ce)\nprint(EDT_value)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.09521\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nADT = EDT_value * 0.80\nADT\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8761682\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, the EDT is variable depending on these four parameters.

To streamline these computations, a Shiny application called [EDT Calculator](https://epidemiologiaufv.shinyapps.io/EDTCalculator/) was developed, enabling users to specify each parameter and assess EDT (and respective 95% CI) under uncertainties in variables such as crop price and fungicide costs.\n\n[![Screenshot of the EDT calculator, a Shiny app for interactive calculation of economic damage threshold (EDT)](imgs/EDT_calculator.png){#fig-EDT fig-align=\"center\"}](https://epidemiologiaufv.shinyapps.io/EDTCalculator/)\n\n### Monitoring season-long weather\n\nDisease warning systems frequently predict conditions conducive to infection of the plant by the pathogen, with wetness and temperature being key variables for many foliar diseases [@bourke1970]. BLITECAST, the first computerized system [@krause1975blitecast] (which combined the Wallin and Hyre systems) provided the means of performing necessary calculations accurately and quickly and issuing recommendations to growers, is an example of successful automated warning system [@krause1975]. While initial inoculum is often undetectable, the presence of inoculum of the pathogen is assumed in many weather-based warning systems. Predictions of an outbreak are possible by tracking environmental conditions favorable for disease development.\n\nWeather-based disease warning systems, like FAST (Forecasting *Alternaria solani* on tomatoes) and Wallin [@madden1978; @wallin1962], continuously monitor moisture and temperature for various crop diseases. These systems calculate weather favorability from environmental data, predicting infection and disease severity. They serve to guide growers on optimal spraying schedules, initiating treatments or determining application intervals based on accumulated severity values over time.\n\n#### Wallin model\n\nJ.R. Wallin developed a model in the mid-20th century focusing on forecasting potato late blight, detailed across several publications [@wallin1962]. The model tracks hourly relative humidity and temperature, emphasizing periods with relative humidity of 90% or more. It calculates the number of high-humidity hours and the corresponding average temperature during the wet period. By accumulating 'disease severity values' (DSV) from plant emergence throughout the season, based on humidity and temperature measures, the model predicts the initial onset and subsequent spread of potato late blight. The table below summarizes the way the DSVs are obtained based on combinations of hours of relative humdity \\> 90% and the air temperature within the wet period.\n\n**Table.** Relationship of temperature and relative humidity (RH) periods as used in the Wallin late blight forecasting system to predict disease severity values (0 to 4).\n\n|                           |       |          |       |       |      |\n|---------------------------|-------|----------|-------|-------|------|\n|                           | Daily | severity | value |       |      |\n| Average Temperature Range | 0     | 1        | 2     | 3     | 4    |\n| 7.2 - 11.6 C              | 15    | 16-18    | 19-21 | 22-24 | \\>25 |\n| 11.7 - 15.0 C             | 12    | 13-15    | 16-18 | 19-21 | \\>22 |\n| 15.1 - 26.6 C             | 9     | 10-12    | 13-15 | 16-18 | \\>19 |\n\nLet's calculate DVS in R based on Wallin's system.

This [app](https://epidemiologiaufv.shinyapps.io/warning-systems/) demonstrates the application of the Wallin (forecast for late blight of potato) and FAST (Forecast for *Alternaria solani* on Tomatoes) rules for calculating DSV, determining the appropriate timing for fungicide sprays (based on a defined threshold), and counting the total sprays during a selected period (@fig-ws_systems).\n\nTo utilize the system, users should select the model, input the latitude and longitude (or choose a location from the map), and specify the time period for the simulation, such as from plant emergence to harvest. The weather data for this simulation is sourced from the NASA Power project via the {nasapower} R package.\n\n[![Screenshot of a web-based warning system for plant diseases based on Wallin\\'s and FAST rules](imgs/ws_systems.png){#fig-ws_systems fig-align=\"center\"}](https://epidemiologiaufv.shinyapps.io/warning-systems/)\n\n### Infection risk during defined periods\n\nMany diseases like late blight of potatoes and early blight of tomatoes, as seen in the previous section, require continuous (season long) risk monitoring to indicate multiple fungicide sprays. However, some warning systems assess risk at only at one time points, such as those crops that are most vulnerable to diseases during specific growth phases. In these cases, a single warning is issued, such as the risk of disease occurrence or occurrence at a intensity above a threshold (e.g. incidence \\> 30%).\n\nSome of these systems use statistical (risk algorithms) to predict probabilities of occurrence of the event (yes/no situation) based on weather variables that occur over specific periods of time, usually when primary infections take place. For example, Fusarium head blight (FHB, caused by *Fusarium graminearum*) disease depends on weather events that occur around the flowering stage, when the crop is most vulnerable. This is also the case of *Sclerotinia* (white mold) diseases that affect flowers and the presence/absence of apothecia is key for risk assessment[@willbur2018]. Such events of binary nature can be predicted using risk algorithms that consider weather variables, cultivar susceptibility, soil moisture, etc. A commonly used algorithm is the logistic regression model which deals with a binary classification.\n\n#### Logistic regression: Ohio FHB models\n\nFHB risk models were developed in the United States in the early 2000s to predict the risk of an epidemic, or when disease severity in the field was greater than 10% [@dewolf2003]. In the paper, the epidemic cases were classified as 0 and 1, according to that threshold, and several logistic regression models were fitted to the data using a summary of weather-related variables from two defined periods: seven days prior to flowering date and 10 days following flowering date (50% of wheat heads with anthers).\n\nAmong several models, the authors found that a single variable model (model A) exhibited a good accuracy (0.83). The selected variable consisted of a combination of temperature and humidity for the 10-day period after flowering. Named TRH9010, it corresponds to the total number of hours, within the 10-day post-flowering period, when the temperature (T) was \\>=15 and \\<= 30 ^o^C and relative humidity (RH) was \\>90%.\n\nLet's implement this model in R and calculate the probability of infection. As usual, we first need to download hourly data from NASA Power project for a period of three years.

The function's arguments are the weather data frame, YEAR, MO, and DY, allowing us to estimate the risk for a specific day (the flowering date) within the downloaded period. It's important to note that, in the original model, the variables were normalized (its value divided by the maximum observed value).

These are designed based on the knowledge of the processes of the disease cycle and the factors that affect these processes [@gonzález-domínguez2023]. These usually operate in a hourly to daily basis and can be quite complex and sophisticated with numerous examples being found in the literature [@salotti2023; @rossi2014; @salotti2022; @caffi2010; @caffi2007].\n\nOne example is a mechanistic model for FHB developed in Brazil. In its core, the model is based on the daily simulation of the flowering process, the most vulnerable phase of the wheat crop, and events that contribute to infect the flowers. The original model [@delponte2005] integrates several sub models that estimate the daily proportion of flowers, a density of inoculum in a \"spore cloud\" and a proportion of infected flowers - all these variables being driven by daily variables of temperature and wetness variables such as rainfall and relative humidity.\n\nA modified, simplified version of the model that takes into account only the flowering process and weather-variables that drives infection, was written in R and is presented here for illustration.\n\n![A simplified version of a mechanistic Fusarium head blight model that takes into account the amount of flowers on each day which will be infected depending on rules that define a wet period and temperature during the wet period.](imgs/FHB_diagram.png){#fig-fhbdiagram fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe function `simulate_FHB()` requires a starting date and weather data frame (adapted here to use NASA Power data set) to run a simulation during 20 days.\n\nAmong the several simplifications, which were based on the simulated results of the original model, flowering dynamics was assumed to follow a normal distribution over 10 days, and is adjusted to ensure that the peak in the proportion of anthers is set to 0.8. An adjustment is made so that anthers are set to 0 after the 10th day.\n\n$[ \\text{antherproportions} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right) & \\text{for } x = 1, \\ldots, 10 \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } x = 11, \\ldots, 20 \\end{array} \\right. ]$ ,\n\nwhere $𝞵$ = 6 and $𝝈$ = 2.\n\nThe probability of the infection of the flowers is calculated as in the paper. It is based on an equation that considers daily temperature (T) and gives the proportion of flowers getting infected on any given day when a **condition for infection** is met.\n\n$INF=0.001029×exp(0.1957×T)$\n\nThere are three conditions for an infection event, similar to what is described in the article [@delponte2005]:\n\n-   **Continuous 2-day Rain & High Humidity**: There should be rain (\\> 0.5 mm) and the average humidity over two consecutive days should be high (\\> 80%).\n\n-   **Rain Followed by Dry Day & High Humidity**: Rain and high humidity (\\> 80%), followed by a day without rain but still with high humidity (\\> 85%).\n\n-   **Dry Day & High Humidity Followed by Rain**: A day without rain but with high humidity (\\> 85%), followed by a day with both rain and high humidity (\\> 80%).\n\nInfection then occurs when any of the above conditions are met. In this simpler version (without the inoculum factor), the proportion of infected spikelets, assuming that infected anthers will give rise to infected spikelets, is given by\n\n$InfectedSpikelets = AntherProportions×INF$\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='warning-systems_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-15_e7533f19926b5211a9467864aa03097e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimulate_FHB <- function(start_date, weather_data) {\n  start_date <- as.Date(start_date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n  \n  #

Notable examples, such as the CPO in Denmark and FARMSCAPE in Australia, have documented this learning process, leading to less reliance on such tools. Growers often favor 'good enough' solutions that evolve from system use, which may reduce the need for direct interaction with the system over time.\n\nHowever, certain diseases with specific control timing requirements, regulatory pressures, or those affecting high-value crops necessitate direct engagement with warning systems. In these scenarios, growers prioritize yield consistency and economic security over reduced pesticide usage, especially when faced with asymmetric risks associated with incorrect management decisions. It has been suggested that disease warning systems might be more beneficial and accepted for crops of intermediate or lower value, where the cost of mismanagement is more balanced. Essential to the success and adoption of these systems is the active involvement of end-users throughout the development process to ensure the system's features align with their practical farming goals and constraints.\n",
