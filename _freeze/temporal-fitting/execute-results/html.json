A few user friendly functions will help us decide which model to choose to obtain the parameters of interest and further compare the epidemics.\n\nTo illustrate, I will use two datasets available in Chapter 3 from the book, *Study of Plant Disease Epidemics* [@chapter2017b]. In the book, SAS codes are presented to perform a few analysis. We provide an alternative code for performing similar analysis, although not perfectly reproducing the results from the book.\n\n### Non-replicated epidemics\n\nWe will compare three DPCs of the incidence of tobacco etch, a virus disease, in peppers. Evaluations of incidence were evaluated at a 7-day interval up to 49 days. The data are available in chapter 4 (page 93) [@chapter2017b]. Let's input the data manually and create a data frame. First column is the assessment time and the other columns correspond to the treatments, called groups in the book, from 1 to 3.\n\n### Entering data\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_fae07568b7d4339547349f5aa391423e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # essential packages \ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16)) # set global theme\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_b3cddc5b2f6a36817622917a43c2e623'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npepper <- \n  tribble(\n   ~t,  ~`1`,  ~`2`,  ~`3`,\n   0,  0.08, 0.001, 0.001,\n   7,  0.13,  0.01, 0.001,\n  14,  0.78,  0.09,  0.01,\n  21,  0.92,  0.25,  0.05,\n  28,  0.99,   0.8,  0.18,\n  35, 0.995,  0.98,  0.34,\n  42, 0.999,  0.99,  0.48,\n  49, 0.999, 0.999,  0.74\n  ) \n```\n:::\n\n\n### Visualize the DPCs\n\nBefore proceeding with model selection and fitting, let's visualize the three epidemics. The code below reproduces quite exactly the top plot of Fig. 4.15 (@chapter2017b page 94). The appraisal of the curves might give us a hint on which models are the best candidates.\n\nBecause the data was entered in the wide format (each DPC is in a different column) we need to reshape it to the long format. The `pivot_longer()` function will do the job of reshaping from wide to long format so we can finally use the `ggplot()` function to produce the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/fig-dpcs_f4797c09ca825dee30885a8c028e113f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npepper |> \n  pivot_longer(2:4, names_to =\"treat\", values_to = \"inc\") |> \n  ggplot (aes(t, inc, \n              linetype = treat, \n              shape = treat, \n              group = treat))+\n  geom_line(size = 1)+\n  geom_point(size =3, shape = 16)+\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 15, y = 0.84, label = \"1\")+\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 23, y = 0.6, label = \"2\")+\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 32, y = 0.33, label = \"3\")+\n  labs(y = \"Disease incidence (y)\",\n       x = \"Time (days)\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Disease progress curves for three tobacco etch epidemics in pepper. Reproduced from @chapter2017b page 94](temporal-fitting_files/figure-html/fig-dpcs-1.png){#fig-dpcs width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost of the three curves show a sigmoid shape with the exception of group 3 that resembles an exponential growth, not reaching the maximum value, and thus suggesting an incomplete epidemic. We can easily eliminate the monomolecular and exponential models and decide on the other two non-flexible models: logistic or Gompertz. To do that, let's proceed to model fitting and evaluate the statistics for supporting a final decision. There are two modeling approaches for model fitting in epifitter: the **linear** or **nonlinear** parameter-estimation methods.\n\n### Fitting: single epidemics\n\nAmong the several options offered by *epifitter* we start with the simplest one, which is fit a model to a single epidemics using the linear regression approach. For such, the `fit_lin()` requires two arguments: time (`time`) and disease intensity (`y`) each one as a vector stored or not in a dataframe.\n\nSince we have three epidemics, `fit_lin()` will be use three times. The function produces a list object with six elements. Let's first look at the `Stats` dataframe of each of the three lists named `epi1` to `epi3`.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_cfe3e2c9811008b84f1cd5d80983661b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(epifitter)\nepi1 <- fit_lin(time = pepper$t,  \n                y = pepper$`1` )\nepi1$Stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 CCC r_squared    RSE\nGompertz      0.9848    0.9700 0.5911\nMonomolecular 0.9838    0.9681 0.5432\nLogistic      0.9782    0.9572 0.8236\nExponential   0.7839    0.6447 0.6705\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_130edc2918512262a7f9479e46aff776'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi2 <- fit_lin(time = pepper$t,  \n  y = pepper$`2` )\nepi2$Stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 CCC r_squared    RSE\nLogistic      0.9962    0.9924 0.4524\nGompertz      0.9707    0.9431 0.8408\nMonomolecular 0.9248    0.8601 1.0684\nExponential   0.8971    0.8134 1.2016\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_afd991fc50918ff31db34b320e628408'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi3 <- fit_lin(time = pepper$t,  \n  y = pepper$`3` )\nepi3$Stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 CCC r_squared    RSE\nLogistic      0.9829    0.9665 0.6045\nGompertz      0.9825    0.9656 0.2263\nExponential   0.9636    0.9297 0.7706\nMonomolecular 0.8592    0.7531 0.2534\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe statistics of the model fit confirms our initial guess that the predictions by the logistic or the Gompertz are closer to the observations than predictions by the other models. There is no much difference between them based on these statistics. However, to pick one of the models, it is important to inspect the curves with the observed and predicted values to check which model is best for all curves.\n\n### Fitting: multiple epidemics\n\nBefore looking at the prediction, let's use another handy function that allows us to simultaneously fit the models to multiple DPC data. Different from `fit_lin()`, `fit_multi()` requires the data to be structured in the long format where there is a column specifying each of the epidemics.\n\nLet's then create a new data set called `pepper2` using the data transposing functions of the *tidyr* package.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_d584a78ba939b3f133f308b97220626b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npepper2 <- pepper |> \n  pivot_longer(2:4, names_to =\"treat\", values_to = \"inc\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we fit the models to all DPCs. Note that the name of the variable indicating the DPC code needs to be informed in `strata_cols` argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_1cad66a4f93398b160d2d90a5d7b852b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi_all <- fit_multi(\n  time_col = \"t\",\n  intensity_col = \"inc\",\n  data = pepper2,\n  strata_cols = \"treat\",\n  nlin = FALSE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's select the statistics of model fitting. Again, *Epifitter* ranks the models based on the CCC (the higher the better) but it is important to check the RSE as well - the lower the better. In fact, the RSE is more important when the goal is prediction.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_3752f19dd64022a9beb02873370295d3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi_all$Parameters |> \n  select(treat, model, best_model, RSE, CCC)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   treat         model best_model       RSE       CCC\n1      1      Gompertz          1 0.5911056 0.9847857\n2      1 Monomolecular          2 0.5431977 0.9838044\n3      1      Logistic          3 0.8235798 0.9781534\n4      1   Exponential          4 0.6705085 0.7839381\n5      2      Logistic          1 0.4523616 0.9961683\n6      2      Gompertz          2 0.8407922 0.9707204\n7      2 Monomolecular          3 1.0683633 0.9247793\n8      2   Exponential          4 1.2015809 0.8971003\n9      3      Logistic          1 0.6045243 0.9829434\n10     3      Gompertz          2 0.2262550 0.9824935\n11     3   Exponential          3 0.7705736 0.9635747\n12     3 Monomolecular          4 0.2533763 0.8591837\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo be more certain about our decision, let's advance to the final step which is to produce the plots with the observed and predicted values for each assessment time by calling the `Data` dataframe of the \\``epi_all` list.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='temporal-fitting_cache/html/fig-fitted_c32cccde66a4a2d9b7129ba9c78e3221'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi_all$Data |>\n filter(model %in% c(\"Gompertz\", \"Logistic\")) |> \n  ggplot(aes(time, predicted, shape = treat)) +\n  geom_point(aes(time, y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ model) +\n coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) + # set the max to 0.6\n  labs(\n    y = \"Disease incidence\",\n    x = \"Time (days after emergence)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Observed (dots) and fitted (line) values for three tobacco etch epidemics in pepper](temporal-fitting_files/figure-html/fig-fitted-1.png){#fig-fitted width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOverall, the logistic model seems a better fit for all the curves.

The curves represent the incidence of soybean plants symptomatic for bud blight caused by tobacco streak virus. Four treatments (different planting dates) were evaluated in randomized complete block design with four replicates. There are four assessment in time for each curve.

For this exercise, we will use both the linear and the nonlinear estimation method.\n\n##### Linear regression\n\nFor convenience, we use the `fit_multi()` to handle multiple epidemics. The function returns a list object where a series of statistics are provided to aid in model selection and parameter estimation.
