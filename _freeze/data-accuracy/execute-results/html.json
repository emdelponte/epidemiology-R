However, errors may occur even when assessing a more objective measure such as incidence. This is the case when an incorrect assignment or confusion of symptoms occur. In either case, the quality of the assessment of any disease variable is very important and should be gauged in the studies. Several terms can be used when evaluating the quality of disease assessments, including reliability, precision, accuracy or agreement.\n\n**Reliability**: The extent to which the same estimates or measurements of diseased specimens obtained under different conditions yield similar results. There are two types. The *inter-rater reliability* (or reproducibility) is a measure of consistency of disease assessment across the same specimens between raters or devices. The *intra-rater* reliability (or repeatability) measures consistency by the same rater or instrument on the same specimens (e.g. two assessments in time by the same rater).\n\n![Two types of reliability of estimates or measures of plant disease intensity](imgs/reliability.png){#fig-reliability.png fig-align=\"center\" width=\"505\"}\n\n**Precision:** A statistical term to express the measure of variability of the estimates or measurements of disease on the same specimens obtained by different raters (or instruments). However, reliable or precise estimates (or measurements) are not necessarily close to an actual value, but precision is a component of accuracy or agreement.\n\n**Accuracy or agreement**: These two terms can be treated as synonymous in plant pathological research. They refer to the closeness (or concordance) of an estimate or measurement to the actual severity value for a specimen on the same scale. Actual values may be obtained using various methods, against which estimates or measurements using an experimental assessment method are compared.\n\nAn analogy commonly used to explain accuracy and precision is the archer shooting arrows at a target and trying to hit the bull's eye (center of the target) with each of five arrows. The figure below is used to demonstrate four situations from the combination of two levels (high and low) for precision and accuracy. The figure was produced using the `ggplot` function of *ggplot2* package.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/fig-target_4dbc8a80f278897866da50e00de93ce5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code

These indices can further be used to test hypothesis such as if one or another method is superior than the other. The indices or the tests vary according to the nature of the variable, whether continuous, binary or categorical.\n\n### Inter-rater reliability\n\nTo calculate measures of inter-rater reliability (or reproducibility) we will work with a fraction of a larger dataset used in a published [study](https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ppa.13148). There, the authors tested the effect of standard area diagrams (SADs) on the reliability and accuracy of visual estimates of severity of soybean rust.\n\nThe selected dataset consists of five columns with 20 rows. The first is the leaf number and the others correspond to assessments of percent soybean rust severity by four raters (R1 to R4). Each row correspond to one symptomatic leaf. Let's assign the tibble to a dataframe called `sbr` (an acronym for soybean rust). Note that the variable is continuous.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_20cbb224cd7b3b4a18c004d331cb99d4'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsbr <- tribble(\n~leaf, ~R1, ~R2,  ~R3, ~R4,\n1, 0.6, 0.6,  0.7, 0.6,\n2,   2, 0.7,    5,   1,\n3,   5,   5,    8,   5,\n4,   2,   4,    6,   2,\n5,   6,  14,   10,   7,\n6,   5,   6,   10,   5,\n7,  10,  18, 12.5,  12,\n8,  15,  30,   22,  10,\n9,   7,   2,   12,   8,\n10,  6,   9, 11.5,   8,\n11,  7,   7,   20,   9,\n12,  6,  23,   22,  14,\n13, 10,  35, 18.5,  20,\n14, 19,  10,    9,  10,\n15, 15,  20,   19,  20,\n16, 17,  30,   18,  13,\n17, 19,  53,   33,  38,\n18, 17, 6.8,   15,   9,\n19, 15,  20,   18,  16,\n20, 18,  22,   24,  15\n         )\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's explore the data using various approaches.

There are several formulations for the ICC whose choice depend on the particular experimental design. Following the convention of the seminal work by @shrout1979, there are three main ICCs:\n\n-   One-way random effects model, ICC(1,1): in our context, each leaf is rated by different raters who are considered as sampled from a larger pool of raters (random effects)\n\n-   Two-way random effects model, ICC(2,1): both raters and leaves are viewed as random effects\n\n-   Two-way mixed model, ICC(3,1): raters are considered as fixed effects and leaves are considered as random.\n\nAdditionally, the ICC may depend on whether the ratings are an average or not of several ratings. When an average is considered, these are called ICC(1,k), ICC(2,k) and ICC(3,k).\n\nThe ICC can be computed using the `ICC()` or the `icc()` functions of the *psych* or *irr* packages, respectively. They both provide the coefficient, F value, and the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_9cef2beb814ba4bf3bef8f6dd35c2a6b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(psych)\nic <- ICC(raters)\nkable(ic$results[1:2]) # only selected columns\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                        |type  |       ICC|\n|:-----------------------|:-----|---------:|\n|Single_raters_absolute  |ICC1  | 0.6405024|\n|Single_random_raters    |ICC2  | 0.6464122|\n|Single_fixed_raters     |ICC3  | 0.6919099|\n|Average_raters_absolute |ICC1k | 0.8769479|\n|Average_random_raters   |ICC2k | 0.8797008|\n|Average_fixed_raters    |ICC3k | 0.8998319|\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# call ic list for full results\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output of interest is a dataframe with the results of all distinct ICCs. We note that the ICC1 and ICC2 gave very close results. Now, let's obtain the various ICCs using the *irr* package. Differently from the the `ICC()` function, this one requires further specification of the model to use.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_df166a2291926cd3ac2d834e6b959613'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(irr)\nicc(raters, \"oneway\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Single Score Intraclass Correlation\n\n   Model: oneway \n   Type : consistency \n\n   Subjects = 20 \n     Raters = 4 \n     ICC(1) = 0.641\n\n F-Test, H0: r0 = 0 ; H1: r0 > 0 \n   F(19,60) = 8.13 , p = 1.8e-10 \n\n 95%-Confidence Interval for ICC Population Values:\n  0.44 < ICC < 0.813\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The one used in the SBR paper\nicc(raters, \"twoway\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Single Score Intraclass Correlation\n\n   Model: twoway \n   Type : consistency \n\n   Subjects = 20 \n     Raters = 4 \n   ICC(C,1) = 0.692\n\n F-Test, H0: r0 = 0 ; H1: r0 > 0 \n   F(19,57) = 9.98 , p = 6.08e-12 \n\n 95%-Confidence Interval for ICC Population Values:\n  0.503 < ICC < 0.845\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient\n\nAnother useful index is the Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient (OCCC) for evaluating agreement among multiple observers. It was proposed by @barnhart2002 based on the original index proposed by @lin1989, earlier defined in the context of two fixed observers. In the paper, the authors introduced the OCCC in terms of the interobserver variability for assessing agreement among multiple fixed observers. As outcome, and similar to the original CCC, the approach addresses the precision and accuracy indices as components of the OCCC. The `epi.occc` function of the *epiR* packge does the job but it does compute a confidence interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_a1b9a66a7f7f382f35ee5762b5add3ff'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(epiR)\nepi.occc(raters, na.rm = FALSE, pairs = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nOverall CCC           0.6372\nOverall precision     0.7843\nOverall accuracy      0.8125\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Intrarater reliability\n\nAs defined, the intrarater reliability is also known as repeatability, because it measures consistency by the same rater at repeated assessments (e.g. different times) on the same sample. In some studies, we may be interested in testing whether a new method increases repeatability of assessments by a single rater compared with another one. The same indices used for assessing reproducibility (interrater) can be used to assess repeatability, and these are reported at the rater level.\n\n### Precision\n\nWhen assessing precision, one measures the variability of the estimates (or measurements) of disease on the same sampling units obtained by different raters (or instruments). A very high precision does not mean that the estimates are closer to the actual value (which is given by measures of bias). However, precision is a component of overall accuracy, or agreement. It is given by the Pearson's correlation coefficient.\n\nDifferent from reliability, that requires only the estimates or measures by the raters, now we need a reference (gold standard) value to compare the estimates to. These can be an accurate rater or measures by an instrument. Let's get back to the soybean rust severity estimation dataset and add a column for the (assumed) actual values of severity on each leaf. In that work, the actual severity values were obtained using image analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_5af2600ac0e7e22e5096a9f5270f4c83'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsbr <- tibble::tribble(\n~leaf, ~actual, ~R1, ~R2,  ~R3, ~R4,\n1,    0.25, 0.6, 0.6,  0.7, 0.6,\n2,     2.5,   2, 0.7,    5,   1,\n3,    7.24,   5,   5,    8,   5,\n4,    7.31,   2,   4,    6,   2,\n5,    9.07,   6,  14,   10,   7,\n6,    11.6,   5,   6,   10,   5,\n7,   12.46,  10,  18, 12.5,  12,\n8,    13.1,  15,  30,   22,  10,\n9,   14.61,   7,   2,   12,   8,\n10,  16.06,   6,   9, 11.5,   8,\n11,   16.7,   7,   7,   20,   9,\n12,   19.5,   6,  23,   22,  14,\n13,  20.75,  10,  35, 18.5,  20,\n14,  23.56,  19,  10,    9,  10,\n15,  23.77,  15,  20,   19,  20,\n16,  24.45,  17,  30,   18,  13,\n17,  25.78,  19,  53,   33,  38,\n18,  26.03,  17, 6.8,   15,   9,\n19,  26.42,  15,  20,   18,  16,\n20,  28.89,  18,  22,   24,  15\n         )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can explore visually via scatter plots the relationships between the actual value and the estimates by each rater ([@fig-scater]).

The CCC combines measures of both precision and accuracy to determine how far the observed data deviate from the line of perfect concordance. Lin's CCC increases in value as a function of the nearness of the data reduced major axis to the line of perfect concordance (the accuracy of the data) and of the tightness of the data about its reduced major axis (the precision of the data).\n\nThe `epi.ccc` function of the *epiR* package allows to obtain the Lin's CCC statistics. Let's filter only rater 2 and calculate the CCC statistics for this rater.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ccc .cell tbl-cap='Statitics of the concordance correlation coefficient summarizing accuracy and precision of visual severity estimates of soybean rust for four raters' hash='data-accuracy_cache/html/tbl-ccc_de38d1759bdfc007285bb9ce26be7fea'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(epiR)\n# Only rater 2\nsbr3 <- sbr2 |> filter(rater == \"R2\")\nccc <- epi.ccc(sbr3$actual, sbr3$estimate)\n# Concordance coefficient\nrho <- ccc$rho.c[,1]\n# Bias coefficient\nCb <- ccc$C.b\n# Precision\nr <- ccc$C.b*ccc$rho.c[,1]\n# Scale-shift\nss <- ccc$s.shift\n# Location-shift\nls <- ccc$l.shift\nMetrics <- c(\"Agreement\", \"Bias coefficient\", \"Precision\", \"scale-shift\", \"location-shift\")\nValue <- c(rho, Cb, r, ss, ls)\nres <- data.frame(Metrics, Value)\nkable(res)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Metrics          |      Value|\n|:----------------|----------:|\n|Agreement        |  0.5230656|\n|Bias coefficient |  0.8948494|\n|Precision        |  0.4680649|\n|scale-shift      |  1.6091178|\n|location-shift   | -0.0666069|\n:::\n:::\n",
